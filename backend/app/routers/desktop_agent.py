"""Endpoints the Claude Desktop Computer Use agent calls while it applies.

The agent runs in the user's own browser, so it reaches these over HTTPS rather
than importing the modules directly. What it needs from the backend: the set of
postings already dealt with (so repeat runs skip them), a way to record a job it
just handled into both the job list and the Tracker, and — once the day's
applications are done — the Cold DMs that are due and a way to record each one
it sends.
